You own a WooCommerce store, so you know that reviews are a key component of a successful online store.

Being able to know from customers who have already purchased that your products are high quality and tested by people just like them is important to build trust in your brand.

== Description ==

Better Product Reviews for WooCommerce is a complete replacement for the existing reviews system used by WooCommerce.

Make your reviews more trustworthy and increase conversions with:

* A fixed 7 point rating for stars
* Allow you to define individual product attributes
* Reviewers can note attributes about themselves, and review viewers can sort through reviews by individual product attribute
* Includes review author characteristics tied to the review to add more context
* Calculate averages to display on product page for both for product rating and product attributes
* Verified reviews for WooCommerce - if the user purchased the product, the review gets flagged as verified
* Display WooCommerce review data for customers - a visual aggregate of the review data is shown above the list, including rating breakdowns, averages, etc.

Care for the back-end of your site by making your reviews more reliable:

* Better Product Reviews for WooCommerce replaces the existing WooCommerce comment system, both front and back end
* Stores data in custom tables instead of comments
* Set WooCommerce reviews to pending - all reviews are set `pending` on submission
